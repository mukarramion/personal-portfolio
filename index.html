                    <summary>My journey to programming</summary>
                    <p>My journey with programming and loving computers starts long back, since i was a fourth-grader. I am from India , many kids weren't that fortunate to have access to internet back then. It started out by visiting my maternal grandfather's house, over there my uncle had access to the internet and I enjoyed my time over there my playing games on my uncle's computer.</p>
                    <p>I got interested in email and facebook back then as it was adult thing to have, went to school bragged about it to my friends and because of that my interest in computer grew and started to show more interest in that subject.</p>
                    <p>In 8th grade i was introduced to java, the first programming language that I learnt at the start I wasn't as great as the others in my class but something in me wanted to be exceptionally amazing in programming.</p>
                    <p>In 10th grade, I started to attend extra classes for becoming better at programming, I started out with loops played with a lot understood programming a little better.Months passed by, and time for my first board exams came by and helped around 10-15 friends with programming. Time skip to now, still love learning, teaching and creating applications and other amazing things with programming.</p>
